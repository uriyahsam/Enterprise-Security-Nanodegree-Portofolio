# Enterprise-Security-Nanodegree-Portofolio
Welcome to my portfolio of projects completed during the Enterprise Security Nanodegree program. This repository showcases my skills and knowledge in enterprise security through various hands-on projects.

## Learning Objectives

A graduate of this program will be able to:
- Build a SIEM and implement enterprise network security best practices to monitor and control network traffic in an enterprise.
- Develop an asset and patch management plan to increase the security posture of endpoints.
- Design a security baseline for application development and conduct internal application security assessments, including threat modeling, vulnerability scanning, and code review.
- Establish data integrity checks and data loss prevention mechanisms to control the types of data that can be transferred out of an enterprise.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Enterprise Perimeter and Network Security

#### Course Project: Securing the Perimeter

**Objective:** 
Build a secure enterprise network, segmenting it across different security topologies, employing the principle of least privilege, and designing a Zero Trust model.

**Key Activities:**
- Design and implement network security architecture using the SABSA framework.
- Connect from public to private networks over a NAT gateway and partition a virtual network into multiple segments.
- Deploy a SIEM, set up alerts, and monitor traffic.
- Build a VPN solution for remote access, create incident response playbooks, and compare current network architecture with a Zero Trust model.

**Deliverables:**
- Secure enterprise network design
- VPN setup and configuration
- SIEM deployment and monitoring
- Incident response playbooks
- Comparative analysis of network architectures

### 2. Enterprise Endpoint Security

#### Course Project: FedF1rst Security Assessment

**Objective:** 
Implement the endpoint portion of an organizationâ€™s security policy, recommend hardening strategies, and conduct a server self-assessment.

**Key Activities:**
- Identify assets and recommend mitigation strategies for discovered vulnerabilities.
- Develop security configurations for Windows and Linux systems.
- Create security policies including NDA and remote work policies.
- Recommend public access configuration strategies for cloud deployments.

**Deliverables:**
- Hardening strategies and build sheets for Windows and Linux systems
- Security policies documentation
- Compliance self-assessment report

### 3. Enterprise-Wide Application Security

#### Course Project: CryptoV4ULT Enterprise Security Assessment

**Objective:** 
Review and enhance the security of a newly released application by performing threat modeling, vulnerability scanning, and creating a remediation plan.

**Key Activities:**
- Conduct threat modeling to identify architecture vulnerabilities.
- Run application vulnerability scans with tools like Nessus and create a pen-testing roadmap.
- Assess and mitigate container and API vulnerabilities.
- Create a remediation plan to prevent future vulnerabilities and harden security standards.

**Deliverables:**
- Threat models and vulnerability reports
- Pen-testing roadmap
- Remediation plan and security hardening recommendations

### 4. Enterprise Data Security

#### Course Project: Data Security Analysis in Online Payment Processing

**Objective:** 
Ensure data security by classifying data, performing file integrity monitoring audits, and developing a comprehensive data security policy.

**Key Activities:**
- Classify data and identify applicable compliance regulations.
- Perform post-breach audits to assess data integrity.
- Develop a data security policy, encryption plan, and backup and recovery strategies.
- Present a data security program update to the executive team.

**Deliverables:**
- Data classification and compliance report
- File integrity monitoring audit results
- Data security policy and encryption plan
- Backup and recovery strategy
- Executive presentation on data security program
